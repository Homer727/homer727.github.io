  <p> Michael Muratori Canvas Game Documentation</p>
  <p> This assignment was a very difficult new code for me to write. I made a game that has a space ship flying through space and avoiding black rectangular obstacles</p>

  <p> I added a royalty free song in the background. (Local Forecast - Elevator By Kevin MacLeod) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXYzF5-Yiw </p>
  <p> An issue I ran into while coding this was with finding out how to add the score. The score kept not appearing on the canvas despite even asking ChatGPT for help. As such I changed it so that the score appears on the screen below the game canvas.</p>

  <p> This code has allowed the score to be displayed under the game area after the game is started. </p>

  <p> Overall this assignment has taught me a lot about both website design and designing a game with html.</p>
